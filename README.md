# MathUwU

Link to project: [MathUwU.com](https://mathuwu.com)

MathUwU aims on being both the Duolingo and Hackerrank of the quantitative finance world. Here's how:

Just like how [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) has revolutionalized learning languages and [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) has revolutionalized typing test, MathUwU aims on creating a fun platform for aspiring quant traders and developers to practice for their quantitative interviews.

One of the most popular practice tools in the market is the [Arithmetic Zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/) game. While popular, Zetamac has a few limitations:
1. Lack of gamification
2. Lack of statistics to help players improve
3. Inability to save scores
4. Lack of more advanced game modes such as decimal and fraction arithmetic, or [Optiver's](https://optiver.com/) 80 in 8 game.

MathUwU introduces a fun, new way to practice for these mental arithmetic tests, which is an integral part of the quantitative finance world.

## Future Product Roadmap

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) have become de-facto platforms when companies hire for programming focused roles. The first round of the interview process usually consists of sending an invitation to an applicant to complete an online test on one of these platforms.

Similarly, we hope that by incorporating invitation & testing administration features into MathUwU, we would be able to allow companies to incorporate MathUwU into the preliminary round of the hiring process.
